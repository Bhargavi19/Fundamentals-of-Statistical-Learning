# Fundamentals-of-Statistical-Learning
Implementing some of the building blocks of machine learning for my own learning
1. Hidden Markov Models :
   Implemented the forward algorithm and classifying sequences to which given HMM model they belong to. 
   Implemented the Viterbi alorithm and generated the hidden state sequences from the observed sequences.
