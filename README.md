# Fundamentals-of-Statistical-Learning
Implementing some of the building blocks of machine learning for my own learning
1. Hidden Markov Models :
   Implemented the forward algorithm from scratch and classifying sequences to which given HMM model they belong to. 
   Implemented the Viterbi alorithm from scratch and generated the hidden state sequences from the observed sequences. 
2. Principal Component Analysis and Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis : 
   Implemented PCA to reduce dimensions of images from 2 classes - '5' and '8' - the MNIST dataset and reconstructing them back. 
   Implemented LDA from scratch to classify them into one of the two classes. Obtained a training accuracy of 94% and a test accuracy of  93%. 
3.  Implemented non-linear regression using zero mean noiseless Gaussian Processes to estimate the function values f(x) = sin(0.5∗x) for x ∈ [−4,4].
